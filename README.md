# Availability of staple foods to the general public #
## Project description ##
Within this project, I am answering defined research questions (see below) that address the affordability of staple foods to the general public based on average incomes over a period of time.
The output of the project is two database tables from which the required data needed to answer the research questions can be extracted.
These tables are: 
- for wage and food price data for the Czech Republic aggregated to the same comparable period - common years
- for additional data on other European countries

Another output is a set of SQLs that extract data from the prepared tables to answer the defined research questions. 

## Researched questions & answers ##
- Have wages in all the sectors been rising over the years, or have they been falling in some?
- How many litres of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data?
- Which food category is becoming more expensive at the slowest rate (lowest percentage increase year on year)?
- Is there a year in which the annual increase in food prices was significantly higher than the increase in wages (greater than 10%)?
- Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if GDP rises more significantly in one year, does this translate into a more significant rise in food prices or wages in the same or subsequent year?

## Datasets used ##
The datasets used for the project are the tables described above: 
- TABLE 1: for wage and food price data for the Czech Republic aggregated to the same comparable period - common years.
- TABLE 2: for additional data on other European countries, including GDP, population and GINI coefficient.
